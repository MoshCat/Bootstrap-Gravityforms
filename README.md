# Gravity Forms Bootstrap styling
Gravity Forms SASS styles for use in your Bootstrap enabled WordPress theme.

__Contributors:__ [Bas Middelham](https://github.com/moshcat)  
__Requires:__ WordPress 5, Gravity Forms 2.4  
__Tested up to:__ WordPress 5, Gravity Forms 2.4.10  

### Usage
The easiest way to use these styles is to clone them into your theme and integrate them into your build process. They will work out of the box with the [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) starter theme and others.

Please use these styles together with [Gravity Forms Bootstrap Hooks](https://github.com/MoshCat/gravityforms-bootstrap-hooks) for full functionality.

Test your styling using this Gravity Forms [kitchensink form](https://github.com/MoshCat/gravityforms-kitchensink).
